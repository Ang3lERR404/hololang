# This project is a semi-toy/non-toy programming language written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

the purpose of this semi-serious programming language is... undefined\
it is more so a learning project to try and make both, an interpreter and a compiler.

# Building from Source

To build this form source, all you'd need to do is:
```batch
git clone https://www.github.com/Ang3lERR404/hololang
cd ./hololang
zig build-exe main.zig
```


# Contributing

Since this is a learning project and a semi-serious project, I'd appreciate collabs, pointers..

Or anything you may think is helpful, and when it comes to actually using the language\
issues will also be open.

this project compiles with version **0.13.0** and will be upgraded with every new stable version released of the zig programming language.
